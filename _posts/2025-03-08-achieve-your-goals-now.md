Don't let time fly before you start achieving your goals. That dreadful feeling of another month passing, another year, but you are not closer to your goals.

## Problem

Here's what makes this so frustrating...

You already know what your goals are. Unlike others who are still searching for direction.

You have the time to do them. Others don't have time, they have 2 jobs, commitments, small kids, or maybe they're even on vacation, but you have the time.

You even have all the tools and resources to do them. But you still don't.

Feels like something invisible is blocking you.

And all of this while there's a big risk: **the risk that the goal you are postponing is not even the goal you're supposed to do**.

So because of this we need to accomplish it as fast as possible to find this now not later.

If we have the guilt and pain of procrastination, at least to have it for the right goal, not the wrong one.

The longer you wait to find out, the more time you waste on potentially the wrong path.

So let's identify what's REALLY blocking you... because it may not be what you think.

## Barriers

### The Manifestation Trap

Thinking that the problem will get solved by wishing or manifesting.

This makes you wait for the problem to solve itself or for someone else to solve it.

**Spoiler alert**: Everyone is busy with their own problems, they won't solve yours.

Instead of using your energy to wish it, use the energy to do it.

> By wishing or manifesting your goal, by definition, **someone has to do the work to make it a reality**, so if you're not the one doing the work, someone else has to do it. There is no other way in this universe.

So unless you're a beggar and waiting for the mercy of a hardworking person, do it.

Unless you're a thief or a looter who steals or forces someone else to do his work for him, do it.

Unless you have the money to hire someone to willingly do it for you, which is the only way everybody wins and it frees you to do other things that need to get done, unless you have the budget to do it, do the task yourself.

**Don't wait for the universe to force someone else to do your work.**

### Afraid of pursuing the wrong goal

You're afraid that this is not the right goal and you postpone the bad news.

But you need to find this as soon as possible, and the only way to find out is to do it. Not by asking 100 people if this is the right goal, watching 100 videos, researching 100 statistics. Basic logic is enough to know that this is not a foolish idea, now do it to be sure is not.

In case it's stupid you will find out for sure before everyone else, while they still fantasise and visualise and meditate about it while taking no action.

And if it was the right thing, you will have the results faster!

This problem becomes even bigger if you think that this goal is the answer to all your problems, you're even more afraid to find out that it's not and to look stupid pursuing it.

During difficult times, you console yourself with the promise that this goal will solve everything. If you pursue it and it doesn't, all hope is gone.

But the reality is that new and BETTER ideas emerge ONLY through action, not hesitation. Even if this isn't your perfect goal, the very act of pursuing it will reveal what your next goal should be. Because you discover new problems to solve along the way.

### You're not convinced the goal is worth pursuing.

Even if you planned your goals, you may not be sure of their success.

This is actually a good point, while pursuing this goal you cannot pursue others, so you're not only losing time if it's not the right goal, but you also postpone working on the right one.

But consider this simple math: if you don't try, your chance of success is exactly 0%. If you try, it's greater than 0%.

And here's a mindset shift that helps:

View it as an experiment, because this takes the pressure off.

If it fails, you have less guilt because experiments are designed to test hypotheses. Everyone knows that experiments can fail, it's part of the process to succeed by learning from each trial and error.

### Perfect Timing Fallacy: You're waiting for the perfect time.

You think that it would be easier if some other events happen first.

If you know for sure this is the case and there is no problem delaying it, then good, wait by doing something else in the meanwhile. But if it's not sure and it's not in your control then it's just an excuse.

Take it as a challenge: if you can do it now when conditions are far from perfect, imagine what you can do when they are! So treat the "perfect timing" just as a bonus, not a requirement. You're grateful if it comes, but you don't need it.

### The Feeling Trap: You don't feel like it.

You remember how it feels to be in the zone, and you're waiting to feel that inspiration before starting, so that you don't lose time forcing yourself.

But here's the secret the achievers know...

The feeling comes AFTER you start, not before.

I'll give you a trick: There's no feeling required to open your computer. No inspiration needed to open the software, no motivation in putting your gym shoes.

By doing these small steps, it means you already started working on your goal.

Assume the feeling will come and continue anyway. If it comes, it's a bonus, otherwise you made great progress so far which is better than waiting and not doing anything.

Most of the time it's harder to stop than to continue, because like a train already in motion, you already gained some momentum and it's harder to make it stop.

Remember:

> There's **no prize** for "feeling it" while achieving your goals. The only thing that matters is whether you complete them or not.

Your child's stomach doesn't get fed because you felt or didn't feel like cooking. Is there something on the plate or not?

Yes, you work faster when feeling it, but if the price is dreadful procrastination, then it's not worth it at all.

The time you win by doing it 10-50% faster, it's just a fraction of the time lost by delaying, feeling guilty and rescheduling the task 10 times before actually starting to work on it.

### Ambiguity Trap: The goal is too ambiguous.

If the next step is not clear then the next step becomes to create the next step.

Break down the goal until you know exactly what action to take next.

Otherwise, you'll waste energy on random activities hoping clarity will magically appear or someone will tell you what to do. Which, like we talked before, it won't happen.

### The Completion Fear

After you do all this and you started working on it, maybe you're afraid to finish it.

Why? Because finishing means judgment time: did it work or not? If not, you invested time for nothing.

Cut through this fear by remembering: if it didn't work, better to know NOW before investing more precious time.

### The Hardness Trap

Your goal might simply be physically or mentally challenging

But remember this truth:

> After you achieve your goal, you won't remember how hard it was — you'll only have the result and the new skills.

If you never start, you will forever feel the weight of the unfinished goal and the confusion that comes from lacking skills that only develop through action.

### The Belief Deficit: You don't believe you can do it.

If your brain doesn't believe you can succeed, it tries to protect you from failure or getting embarrassed or whatever is at stake.

So either believe in yourself by manning up, remembering a past success, or reduce the pressure by treating it as an experiment.

### The Moving Finish Line

You don't know when a goal is done, so how can you start a journey without knowing the destination? You wouldn't know to go left or right.

Define when that specific task is done and do everything to complete it. Otherwise you treat it like a painting which is never finished since you can always do something on it.

Be very specific. _"Learn Spanish"_ is not that helpful because you don't have a specific target, you'll never feel finished.

_"Learn 10 medical terms in Spanish today"_ is. You can continue learning more as a bonus after you finished the task, but otherwise you will never feel finished.

### The Control Illusion: Thinking this is not in your control.

Then don't do it. You cannot do anything about it, whatever you do you cannot influence the problem, so don't burn gas on it. Use that gas on what IS under your control.

You can't control getting a million YouTube views, but you can control making excellent videos. Just be specific what "excellent" means, otherwise it will forever be an unfinished painting.

## Solution

When you notice yourself overthinking a task, you have only THREE options:

1. Start working on it immediately
2. Delegate it to someone else
3. Write it down in a system you trust to tackle it later

Anything else leads to what I call **"Task Inflation"**: where tasks grow bigger in your mind the longer you avoid them.

You start thinking the task requires special preparation, perfect conditions, rituals, and cosmic alignment.

It doesn't. It's not special. Do it and forget it.

### Overwhelmed by Ideas

Sometimes you feel overwhelmed by so many ideas and goals competing for attention.

You can calm your mind by writing the goals down in a safe space where you know you will come back to plan or work on them.

You can use <a href="https://perspectask.com">PerspecTask</a>, my application for task management, it's end to end encrypted, meaning that it's impossible for me to see your goals, unlike other task managers.

Even while working on a goal you may get tons of ideas and most of the anxiety comes from fear of forgetting them.

Open your task manager and write them down to make sure you won't forget them, you can plan and prioritize them at a later time.

When you have multiple or complex goals, it's harder to see progress. But seeing progress is critical for motivation. When building a house you can literally see the progress in your face, but with many goals you can't.

That's why I implemented all kinds of subtle progress tracking in my application: for tasks, for periods and more.

It takes time and effort to track and calculate progress and it can stop you from actually working on the goal, it can become a reason to procrastinate. And **the last thing you need is another reason to procrastinate, even if it's useful.**

That's why I did this so it can automatically and instantly calculate progress without requiring extra work from you.

### Bonus Trick 1

You can procrastinate on your goal by working on another goal that you want to do, which is a smart way to procrastinate.

But you can only go so far with this because at some point you need to do your main task.

### Bonus Trick 2

Using the previous idea, let's actually work on the goal we procrastinate by creating a bigger goal than it, so you can "procrastinate" on the bigger goal by doing the one you actually want to do.

The fact that this works proves the barrier is psychological and you blow it out of proportions in your head.

## Conclusion

So what happens when you implement this system?

The pressure and pain of procrastination disappears - not by giving up on your goals, but by breaking them down, prioritising and achieving them.

Imagine waking up each morning with complete clarity on exactly what you need to work on.

Imagine watching your progress bar fill up day by day.

Imagine checking off goals that once seemed impossible, one by one, building unstoppable momentum.

This isn't just about getting things done, it's about becoming the person who consistently turns ideas into reality.

The true enemy of procrastination isn't motivation or discipline—it's action.

**So don't focus on beating procrastination, focus on taking action, and procrastination will automatically be taken care of, no need to do anything about it.**
